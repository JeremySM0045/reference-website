1. Naming convention for all filenames, paths and folders
- The naming conventions for all filenames should be lowercase, no spaces and dashes are fine. Folder 
naming convention should be similar to filenames. For paths, the folders, assets and files should be
inside the root folder so they can be easily linked to any .html files `index.html` 

2. Best practices for commit messages
- When it comes to best practices, there's a few things to consider. Firstly, you want to be specific about what the
commitment includes. the commit should be consistant and include as much detail about the changes made, rather than 
simply writing `updated index.html`. For example, when I push for this question I would write 
`completed question 2 regarding best practices for commit messages.` Secondly, if you were to be working on a code with a 
team, you want to make sure to properly identify yourself, your changes as well as any comments you'd like the others to see.
This will make your changes a great deal easier to read and understand. Lastly, make sure to keep your commits diverse. They 
don't need to be particularly unique, but distinct enough to be told apart. 

3. What is HTML?
The term HTML itself stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. This
scripting language's purpose lies in the ability to describe, define and isolate elements found on any and all web pages. The tags that make up this language are mainly used to identify the 
purpose of an element, such as the `<p></p>` tags, that define the
start and finish of a paragraph element, or more involved tags like
`<nav></nav>` that helps define a functional navigation system. HTML does not involve anything to do with functionalty and appearance, that would rather be with `CSS and JS`.
